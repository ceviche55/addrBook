## Description
The address book project involves creating a program that allows users to store and manage contact information. It serves as a digital directory where users can add, search, update, and delete contacts. The program should provide a user-friendly interface and offer features to efficiently manage a collection of contacts.

## My Goals
I want to practice my c++ skills, and this is a basic one to start with.

Goals:
- Use data structures
- Practice commenting
- Practice making an app all the way through

Update (5/31):
I will be putting json and persistence on paues due to difficulty with importing cpp libraries and documentation
